# in-process quality monitoring transforms final inspection from discovery to confirmation

The challenged assumption: quality lives at the end of the line. Build the thing, then check if it's good. Rework is far more expensive than doing it right the first time. Late-stage failures are most expensive because they've accumulated the most value-add. Continuous monitoring flips this: quality becomes a continuous property of the entire process. By the time a part reaches final inspection, confidence in its quality is already high. Final inspection doesn't disappear (physics is physics, customers want proof) but changes from "find out if good" to "confirm what we already know." Surprises drop dramatically.

## Relevant Notes
- [[quality escapes are the most valuable learning signal because they reveal unknown failure modes]]
- [[continuous process monitoring collapses the metrics hierarchy by seeing all four levels simultaneously]]
- [[small adaptive adjustments compound across stations shifts and days into meaningful throughput and quality gains]]
- [[computer vision inspection runs at 1200 parts per minute on the edge because millisecond latency makes cloud inference impractical]] — the deployed technology that makes in-process monitoring real at line speed
- [[the cost of quality optimization problem collapses when AI makes prevention nearly free at the margin]] — the economic consequence: prevention dominates when monitoring is continuous
- [[sampling-based quality is design debt from when 100 percent inspection was too expensive for humans]] — in-process monitoring is what makes sampling obsolete
