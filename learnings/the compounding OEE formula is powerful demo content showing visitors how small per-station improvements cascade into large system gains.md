# the compounding OEE formula is powerful demo content showing visitors how small per-station improvements cascade into large system gains

The system OEE compounding formula — OEE_system = (OEE_i)^n — is not just an engineering constraint but a persuasion tool. When displayed live on a [[the mode comparison dashboard must update within 1-2 seconds of a mode change to maintain the cause-and-effect demo experience which demands edge processing|real-time dashboard]], visitors see how switching a single station from Manual to Autonomous mode doesn't just improve that station's OEE — it multiplicatively improves the entire line.

The demo sequence:
1. Show the line running with all stations in Manual mode. Display per-station OEE and system OEE.
2. Switch Station 3 (testing) to Autonomous. Watch Station 3's OEE jump from ~85% to ~95%.
3. The system OEE dashboard updates in real time — the gain is visibly larger than just Station 3's improvement due to compounding.
4. The audience sees: "A 10% improvement at one station creates a >10% improvement to the whole system."

This is the mathematical proof that [[a togglable mode dial that switches each station between manual assisted and autonomous generates live comparative evidence that software creates measurable value|software creates measurable value]]. The compounding effect means the value is always larger than what you'd naively expect from improving a single station — which is counterintuitive and therefore memorable.

The formula also demonstrates why the mode dial is not just a demo gimmick but a production management tool: in real production, temporarily switching a struggling station to Assisted mode to stabilize its OEE prevents the multiplicative cascade from degrading the entire line. This is [[system OEE compounds multiplicatively across stations so a five-station line targeting 90 percent system OEE requires each station at 97-9 percent|the reliability argument]] translated into live evidence.

Relevant Notes:
- [[system OEE compounds multiplicatively across stations so a five-station line targeting 90 percent system OEE requires each station at 97-9 percent]] — the mathematical foundation for this demo
- [[a togglable mode dial that switches each station between manual assisted and autonomous generates live comparative evidence that software creates measurable value]] — the compounding formula makes the mode dial's value tangible
- [[the mode comparison dashboard must update within 1-2 seconds of a mode change to maintain the cause-and-effect demo experience which demands edge processing]] — real-time update is critical for the demo sequence to work
- [[demo factories that convert visitors combine recognizable products visible customization a moment of truth and product changeover as the primary demonstration]] — the compounding OEE moment IS a "moment of truth" in the demo
- [[OEE component decomposition tells different stories across modes where performance shows the biggest gap and availability stays roughly constant]] — the dashboard shows both the system roll-up and the per-mode decomposition
