# only 189 of millions of factories have achieved full digital transformation while 70 percent remain stuck in pilot purgatory

The WEF/McKinsey Global Lighthouse Network identifies manufacturing sites that successfully implement Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies at scale. The source article cited "approximately 103" lighthouses, but this is outdated — the network reached 189 sites across 33 countries by January 2025, with 12 more added in September 2025. The network grew from 16 in 2018 to 153, then to 189.

Even at ~200, this is vanishingly small relative to the millions of factories worldwide. The 70% "pilot purgatory" claim persists in WEF/McKinsey materials, attributed to the time lag between the idea of digital value delivery and the reality of implementing, optimizing, and scaling. The average US factory is 25+ years old. Greenfield smart factory construction costs $1-1.3 billion in automotive — roughly 200x the cost of brownfield upgrades. This brownfield reality is precisely why the winning architecture must [[a unified integration layer creates a common nervous system across heterogeneous equipment without replacing anything|accommodate serial Modbus devices alongside cloud-native AI]] without requiring forklift upgrades.
