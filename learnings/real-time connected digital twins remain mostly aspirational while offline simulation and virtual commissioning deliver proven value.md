# real-time connected digital twins remain mostly aspirational while offline simulation and virtual commissioning deliver proven value

Digital twins exist on a spectrum. Offline plant simulation (Siemens Plant Simulation, FlexSim, Simio) — discrete-event simulation for material flow, throughput, and bottleneck identification — is widely deployed and delivers proven value. Virtual commissioning tests PLC programs against virtual plant models before installation. True real-time connected digital twins that continuously mirror live production remain limited to advanced manufacturers and high-value applications.

The market was valued at $13.6B in 2024, projected to $428B by 2034 (41.4% CAGR). But independent analysis confirms "the widespread adoption many expected hasn't quite materialized." Companies that deploy successfully report 10-20% production output increases and up to 35% cost reductions, but many struggle to quantify ROI. Real-time twins are expensive to run (handling live data requires significant compute) and face legacy system integration challenges. Deloitte's 2025 survey found 92% of manufacturers consider smart manufacturing the primary driver of future competitiveness — but "considering" is not "deploying." Most vendor marketing implies more than factory floor reality delivers. The honest position: offline simulation is production-ready; real-time connected twins are an emerging capability, not an established one.
