# digital inventory replaces physical warehousing making on-demand micro-manufacturing economically rational at any scale

The single biggest economic unlock for small-scale manufacturing is eliminating physical inventory entirely. When products are stored as digital files and manufactured on demand, Days Inventory Outstanding approaches zero — transforming the [[cash conversion cycle measures how long cash stays tied up in operations|cash conversion cycle]] from a working capital trap into a non-issue.

Deutsche Bahn's digital warehouse stores ~1,000 virtual part models (targeting 10,000 by 2030) and has printed 200,000+ parts across 1,000+ applications, saving over €20M. They replaced 10-month foundry lead times with 5-month AM lead times for critical components. BASF spin-off Replique connects OEMs to 250+ global production partners with 500+ materials via encrypted digital inventory — Miele sells 3D-printed accessories through its online shop, manufactured only when ordered. Spare part costs increase up to 20× with traditional remanufacturing after serial production ends, while McKinsey estimates global warehousing costs at $320B/year.

This is [[institutional design debt accumulates when systems optimize for constraints that technology has already eliminated|institutional design debt]] made concrete: the assumption that you must manufacture-then-store was a constraint of slow, expensive, tooling-dependent production. Digital manufacturing (3D printing, software-defined CNC, AI-driven process setup) eliminates the constraint, but the warehousing infrastructure remains because organizations haven't updated their assumptions.

For Somana's mini factory, digital inventory means zero finished goods storage, zero obsolescence risk, and working capital requirements that scale with order flow rather than forecast accuracy. Combined with [[AI reduces cycle time not by making processing faster but by eliminating the 90 percent of time that is coordination waste|AI-compressed cycle times]], the make-to-order model becomes fast enough to compete with ship-from-warehouse.

## Relevant Notes

- [[cash conversion cycle measures how long cash stays tied up in operations]] — digital inventory drives DIO toward zero
- [[institutional design debt accumulates when systems optimize for constraints that technology has already eliminated]] — warehousing is design debt from when manufacturing required tooling and long lead times
- [[AI reduces cycle time not by making processing faster but by eliminating the 90 percent of time that is coordination waste]] — fast enough cycle time makes on-demand competitive with inventory
- [[Little's Law connects WIP throughput and cycle time as WIP equals throughput times cycle time]] — zero inventory means WIP is the only material in the system
- [[customization inverts the small-scale penalty into a premium when each product is inherently unique]] — customization and digital inventory are complementary: when every product is unique, physical inventory is impossible anyway
- [[the manufacturing planning cascade from S&OP to MRP to finite scheduling could be collapsed by AI doing real-time planning across all horizons]] — collapsing the planning cascade enables the real-time scheduling that makes on-demand production feasible
- [[variability must be buffered by inventory capacity or time and lean manufacturing minimizes the total cost of buffering not the buffers themselves]] — digital inventory eliminates the inventory buffer entirely, shifting all buffering to capacity and time
