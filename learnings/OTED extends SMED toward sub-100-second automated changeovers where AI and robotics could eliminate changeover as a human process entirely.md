# OTED extends SMED toward sub-100-second automated changeovers where AI and robotics could eliminate changeover as a human process entirely

OTED (One-Touch Exchange of Die) is the advanced extension of SMED targeting changeovers under 100 seconds — via a single touch, lever, button, or command. No manual adjustments, alignments, or tools needed. Practical implementations include molds with automatic alignment plus hydraulic clamping, robotic tool-changing systems, electronic pre-configuration of parameters, and modular devices with quick-connect interfaces. Poka-yoke mechanisms prevent errors: asymmetric alignment guides, shape-coded connectors, RFID/QR verification of correct tool installation, and presence sensors blocking startup if misaligned.

OTED already points toward the AI-era evolution: if changeover can be reduced to pressing a button, it can be reduced to a software command. AI scheduling could optimize not just the production sequence but the changeover sequence itself — pre-positioning tools, pre-heating molds, pre-loading parameters, and coordinating robotic execution. The entire [[SMED attacks changeover time through a five-step framework that separates internal from external work reducing setup by an average of 94 percent|SMED framework]] is human process improvement methodology; OTED begins the transition to automated changeover where the distinction between "internal" and "external" work dissolves because machines handle both.

This connects to [[the gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity narrows under AI because it was largely caused by human and organizational limitations|the capacity gap closing under AI]] — changeover time is a major contributor to the gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity. It also validates [[institutional design debt accumulates when systems optimize for constraints that technology has already eliminated|design debt]]: SMED's 5 steps optimize for the constraint that humans must perform changeovers. When that constraint lifts, the entire methodology becomes [[setup cost and optimal batch size are mathematically linked through EOQ so reducing changeover time enables smaller batches and leaner inventory|a special case where S approaches zero]] and single-piece flow becomes the default rather than the aspiration.

## Relevant Notes
- [[SMED attacks changeover time through a five-step framework that separates internal from external work reducing setup by an average of 94 percent]]
- [[setup cost and optimal batch size are mathematically linked through EOQ so reducing changeover time enables smaller batches and leaner inventory]]
- [[the gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity narrows under AI because it was largely caused by human and organizational limitations]]
- [[institutional design debt accumulates when systems optimize for constraints that technology has already eliminated]]
- [[dynamic bottleneck management makes the constraint a managed variable rather than an observed fact]]
- [[AI compresses factory ramp timelines because AI capability deploys instantly while human skill takes months to develop]]
