# somana product

## Edge Infrastructure
- [[edge compute is necessary for real-time manufacturing control because cloud latency exceeds response requirements]]
- [[edge AI adoption follows a PoC-to-platform progression where infrastructure deployment replaces isolated use case development]] — validates Somana's platform approach over vertical solutions

## Integration
- [[equipment heterogeneity across vendors protocols and decades is what kills most automation projects]]
- [[a unified integration layer creates a common nervous system across heterogeneous equipment without replacing anything]]

## Observe
- [[continuous process monitoring collapses the metrics hierarchy by seeing all four levels simultaneously]]

## Control
- [[adaptive control responds to condition combinations too complex for human-authored rules]]
- [[small adaptive adjustments compound across stations shifts and days into meaningful throughput and quality gains]]

## Quality
- [[in-process quality monitoring transforms final inspection from discovery to confirmation]]
- [[quality escapes are the most valuable learning signal because they reveal unknown failure modes]]

## Maintenance
- [[predictive maintenance uses already-flowing process data rather than requiring dedicated condition monitoring hardware]]

## Scale
- [[cross-site knowledge transfer means each subsequent factory deployment ramps faster than the previous one]]

## What to Manufacture
- [[SMT electronics assembly is the most viable office-scale production process because it combines multi-step flow with rich data and natural product changeovers]] — convergent finding: best testbed AND viable commercial product at small batch
- [[customization inverts the small-scale penalty into a premium when each product is inherently unique]] — small scale is a strategic feature when products are inherently batch-of-one
- [[digital inventory replaces physical warehousing making on-demand micro-manufacturing economically rational at any scale]] — eliminates the warehousing assumption, drives DIO toward zero
- [[in micro-manufacturing the competitive moat is software not hardware because design automation and scheduling determine who can serve high-mix demand profitably]] — the software IS the manufacturing advantage; the mini factory proves it works

Agent Notes:
- 2026-02-20: "What to Manufacture" section now has four tightly interconnected learnings: SMT assembly (the process), customization (the business model), digital inventory (the economics), software moat (the competitive positioning). Together they form a complete argument for Somana's mini factory strategy. The SMT→customization→digital inventory→software moat chain is the strongest narrative path for explaining the product thesis.
