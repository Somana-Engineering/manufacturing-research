# capital structure should evolve from equity to debt as technology risk gives way to execution risk

Capital progression follows a predictable pattern matched to risk type:

- **Early stage** — equity / venture capital: highest cost of capital, most flexible, funds R&D and technology risk where outcomes are uncertain and collateral doesn't exist.
- **Scale-up** — venture debt, equipment financing: extends runway and reduces dilution, but requires proven metrics and some track record of unit economics.
- **Mature** — project finance, asset-backed lending: collateralized against real assets, lowest cost of capital, requires demonstrated and predictable unit economics.

The key insight is to match the capital type to the risk profile. Technology risk — will this process work at all? — needs equity flexibility because the downside is total loss. Execution risk — can we do this reliably at scale? — can be financed with debt because the outcomes are bounded and somewhat predictable.

The transition point is when unit economics become predictable. That moment is when a company should aggressively shift its capital structure toward lower-cost debt, freeing equity capacity for the next technology bet rather than funding known-quantity scaling.

The GenAI disruption audit argues AI accelerates the progression from equity-appropriate to debt-appropriate by reducing technology risk through better simulation, faster iteration, and predictive modeling. Companies might use less equity and more debt earlier. But AI introduces model risk — a genuinely new category. What if the AI's process control model is wrong or optimizes for a local minimum? Real-time data sharing could also reduce information asymmetry with lenders, potentially replacing discrete covenants with continuous risk assessment.
