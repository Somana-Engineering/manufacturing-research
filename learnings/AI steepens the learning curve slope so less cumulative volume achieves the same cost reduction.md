# AI steepens the learning curve slope so less cumulative volume achieves the same cost reduction

Wright's Law is one of the most robust empirical relationships in manufacturing, but its six drivers are all subject to AI acceleration: (1) Labor efficiency — "practice" becomes model training; learning isn't lost when a worker quits. (2) Process optimization — AI identifies bottlenecks faster, proposes and implements solutions; the human bottleneck is cognitive bandwidth. (3) Yield improvement — AI dramatically accelerates the yield S-curve. (4) Design for Manufacturing — generative design optimizes for manufacturability from day one, compressing the months-long DFM feedback loop to days. (5) Supplier development — less directly affected, one of the more resilient drivers. (6) Economies of scale — AI makes smaller-scale more efficient, so this driver matters less relative to the others.

The meta-disruption: if AI accelerates all learning mechanisms, you get more learning per unit of volume. An 80% learning curve might become a 70% learning curve (30% reduction per doubling instead of 20%). Intelligence invested (model training, data infrastructure, algorithmic sophistication) becomes a co-equal or even dominant driver of cost reduction alongside cumulative volume. Companies with less volume but better AI can descend the cost curve faster than high-volume competitors with traditional operations.

## Relevant Notes
- [[Wright's Law predicts manufacturing costs decline by a fixed percentage with each cumulative production doubling]]
- [[AI yield optimization finds multivariate root causes that flatten the S-curve and compress years of learning into months]]
- [[the competitive moat shifts from accumulated production volume to data infrastructure quality and AI model sophistication]] — the direct consequence: if AI steepens the curve, then data infrastructure quality matters more than cumulative volume for competitive positioning
