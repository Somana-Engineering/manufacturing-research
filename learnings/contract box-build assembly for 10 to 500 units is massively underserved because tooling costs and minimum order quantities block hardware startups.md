# contract box-build assembly for 10 to 500 units is massively underserved because tooling costs and minimum order quantities block hardware startups

The contract assembly market reveals a painful gap at the 10–500 unit range. MacroFab serves this segment with no minimum quantities using AI-powered quoting (FabIQ) across 80+ factory lines. Tempo Automation, which raised $74.6M and went public via SPAC, processed average orders of roughly 10 units across 200+ customers before filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2023 with $57.7M in liabilities. The lesson: explosive demand exists at small batch sizes, but unit economics are punishing at conventional overhead levels.

All-in costs for a 100-unit box build (custom PCB + enclosure + cables + packaging) typically run $50–$400 per unit, with NRE fees of $300–$1,000 for small orders. At 10 units, per-unit costs multiply 2–5× due to setup amortization. The dominant pain points hardware startups report: minimum order quantity barriers, cost opacity (hidden fees), 8–12 week production cycles, communication gaps with offshore manufacturers, and $5,000–$15,000 injection mold tooling that makes custom enclosures prohibitive.

3D printing eliminates the tooling barrier entirely — [[digital inventory replaces physical warehousing making on-demand micro-manufacturing economically rational at any scale|digital inventory for enclosures]] means zero tooling cost, zero tooling lead time, and design iteration between orders at no additional cost. A micro-factory with [[3D printers that produce enclosures should simultaneously produce assembly fixtures and test jigs at near-zero marginal tooling cost|in-house 3D printing]] can serve the exact market Tempo proved exists, without Tempo's overhead. The assembly capability is itself a service product: visitors see boarding boxes, IoT sensors, and STEM kits being assembled, and the implicit message is "we can assemble YOUR product here too."

## Relevant Notes
- [[digital inventory replaces physical warehousing making on-demand micro-manufacturing economically rational at any scale]] — eliminates the $5–15K injection mold barrier
- [[3D printers that produce enclosures should simultaneously produce assembly fixtures and test jigs at near-zero marginal tooling cost]] — print enclosures for customer products too
- [[customization inverts the small-scale penalty into a premium when each product is inherently unique]] — hardware startups need batch-of-one or batch-of-ten
- [[in micro-manufacturing the competitive moat is software not hardware because design automation and scheduling determine who can serve high-mix demand profitably]] — AI quoting and scheduling differentiate a micro-factory from a job shop
- [[setup cost and optimal batch size are mathematically linked through EOQ so reducing changeover time enables smaller batches and leaner inventory]] — 3D printing drives setup cost toward zero for enclosures
- [[demo factories that convert visitors combine recognizable products visible customization a moment of truth and product changeover as the primary demonstration]] — the assembly capability is inherently a demo: visitors see boarding boxes assembled and realize "you could assemble MY product here"
- [[progressive automation pays for itself when each phase demonstrates ROI before funding the next investment]] — contract assembly service could self-fund from Phase 1 (manual, $2K) with real customer revenue
- [[contract box-build becomes a design intelligence service when mode-tagged data generates empirical DFA report cards for every customer product]] — transforms commodity assembly into design consultancy: the DFA report card is the differentiator over conventional CEMs
- [[DFA feedback credibility requires production volume that new customer relationships lack]] — the tension: first-batch customers need DFA feedback most but have the least data to support it
