# institutional design debt accumulates when systems optimize for constraints that technology has already eliminated

When a system is designed under constraint C, and technology eliminates or dramatically weakens C, the system carries design debt — its architecture still optimizes for a constraint that no longer binds. The system continues to work, but it's suboptimal in ways invisible to people who grew up inside it.

Applied to manufacturing: factory economics concepts, metrics, and management frameworks were designed when human cognition was the only tool for analysis, information was expensive to collect and process, decision-making had to be centralized because expertise was scarce, and abstraction was necessary because nobody could process raw granular data. GenAI breaks most of these constraints. Every simplification, aggregation, sampling strategy, periodic review cycle, and hierarchical diagnostic process was necessary because humans couldn't process granular, continuous, multivariate reality. AI can. The companies that recognize this design debt earliest will have a structural advantage — they'll be optimizing the actual system while competitors optimize simplified models of it.

## Relevant Notes
- [[factory costs divide into fixed variable and semi-variable categories that determine operating leverage]]
- [[the manufacturing metrics hierarchy cascades from financial outcomes to root cause indicators across four levels]]
- [[sampling-based quality is design debt from when 100 percent inspection was too expensive for humans]] — concrete example: AQL exists because inspection was expensive
- [[the manufacturing planning cascade from S&OP to MRP to finite scheduling could be collapsed by AI doing real-time planning across all horizons]] — concrete example: sequential planning exists because humans plan one horizon at a time
- [[the Unified Namespace promises any-to-any data flow but UNS without governance becomes chaos at scale]] — the N×N integration pattern being replaced is itself design debt
- [[OEE framework becomes less useful as its simplifying assumptions become limitations rather than helpful abstractions]] — concrete example: OEE decomposition was useful for humans, misleading for AI
