# how does AI model risk map to the existing risk-capital matching framework for manufacturing financing

AI infrastructure as a capital category has hybrid risk characteristics: high uncertainty during development (equity-like) but predictable ROI once deployed (debt-like). The risk-capital matching framework needs a new row for "AI/data infrastructure." How do lenders view AI model risk? Does real-time operational data sharing — authenticated by AI and IoT — reduce information asymmetry enough to change covenant structures? Could continuous risk assessment replace discrete covenants?

These questions matter because they determine whether AI-driven manufacturing gets funded through traditional channels or requires new financing models. The [[AI introduces model risk as a genuinely new category that the risk-capital framework does not capture|model risk tension]] suggests the current framework is insufficient, but the solution isn't clear. This is an open research question with direct implications for Somana's fundraising and customer financing strategies.

## Relevant Notes
- [[capital structure should evolve from equity to debt as technology risk gives way to execution risk]]
- [[AI introduces model risk as a genuinely new category that the risk-capital framework does not capture]]
