# OEE framework becomes less useful as its simplifying assumptions become limitations rather than helpful abstractions

OEE is a useful diagnostic framework but it's a simplified model of reality. The three components are treated as independent multipliers, but they're deeply interconnected: running equipment faster may reduce quality; skipping maintenance improves short-term availability but degrades long-term performance. AI can model these interactions and optimize the actual throughput function, not the simplified OEE decomposition.

The "world-class OEE = 85%" benchmark is design debt — it's the ceiling for human-managed operations. AI-managed operations should exceed this benchmark because AI can predict and prevent unplanned downtime (improving availability beyond human maintenance planning), optimize equipment speed in real-time based on conditions (improving performance without sacrificing quality), and maintain near-perfect quality through real-time process control. The tension: OEE was a helpful abstraction for human cognition — it gave managers a single number to track and a decomposition to diagnose. But for AI-managed systems that can work with underlying reality directly, the simplification becomes a limitation that obscures the interconnections it was designed to hide.

## Relevant Notes
- [[OEE decomposes into availability performance and quality to diagnose where operational capacity is lost]]
- [[the gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity narrows under AI because it was largely caused by human and organizational limitations]]
