# AI enables learning transfer across products and factories breaking Wright's Law assumption that learning is product-specific

Wright's Law traditionally assumes learning is product-specific and factory-specific. AI breaks this boundary. The process knowledge gained from manufacturing Product A at Factory X can be partially transferred to Product B at Factory Y through shared AI models. This means cumulative volume — the x-axis of the learning curve — can be measured at company or even industry level, not just product level.

A new entrant doesn't need to produce millions of units to reach competitive yields — they can leverage learning from other products, other factories, even other companies' published process data through AI models trained on diverse manufacturing contexts. This is directly connected to what [[cross-site knowledge transfer means each subsequent factory deployment ramps faster than the previous one|Somana already does with cross-site knowledge transfer]], but the disruption audit extends the principle further: not just across sites but across products and potentially across companies.

## Relevant Notes
- [[Wright's Law predicts manufacturing costs decline by a fixed percentage with each cumulative production doubling]]
- [[cross-site knowledge transfer means each subsequent factory deployment ramps faster than the previous one]]
- [[the competitive moat shifts from accumulated production volume to data infrastructure quality and AI model sophistication]] — cross-product learning transfer is the mechanism through which data infrastructure replaces production volume as the competitive moat
