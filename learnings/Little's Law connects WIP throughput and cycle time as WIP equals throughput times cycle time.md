# Little's Law connects WIP throughput and cycle time as WIP equals throughput times cycle time

Little's Law: WIP = Throughput x Cycle Time

This deceptively simple relationship has powerful implications. Reducing cycle time directly reduces WIP inventory and therefore working capital requirements. If you halve cycle time at constant throughput, you halve the inventory sitting on the factory floor.

Conversely, the law provides a diagnostic tool: if WIP is building up, either throughput has dropped or cycle time has increased. Monitoring WIP levels serves as a proxy for line health — rising WIP is an early warning signal that something in the system has degraded, even before throughput metrics reflect the problem.

For startups, this relationship connects manufacturing operations directly to cash requirements. Every day of cycle time reduction frees working capital that can be deployed elsewhere.

## Relevant Notes

- [[processing time is typically less than 10 percent of total manufacturing cycle time]]
- [[cash conversion cycle measures how long cash stays tied up in operations]]
- [[takt time synchronizes production pace to customer demand]]
- [[the VUT equation shows that cycle time grows exponentially with utilization when variability is present creating a trap most factories fall into]] — Little's Law translates VUT's cycle time explosion into proportional WIP explosion
- [[the setup-batch-inventory-cash chain links changeover time to batch size to WIP to cycle time to working capital through four mathematical relationships]] — Little's Law is the third link in the chain, converting WIP to cycle time
- [[manufacturing line parameters form a connected system where takt time is the only external input and five leverage points determine where intervention cascades most]] — Little's Law forms the "flow triangle" at the center of the parameter network
