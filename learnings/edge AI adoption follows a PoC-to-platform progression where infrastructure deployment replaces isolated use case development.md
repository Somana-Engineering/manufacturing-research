# edge AI adoption follows a PoC-to-platform progression where infrastructure deployment replaces isolated use case development

The edge AI market is maturing from isolated proofs of concept to platform-based deployment. Barbara (edge AI platform provider) reports 4x growth in enterprise inquiries during 2024, and analysts predict 50% of enterprises will adopt edge computing by 2025, up from 20% in 2024. The shift is from "let's try edge AI on one use case" to "let's deploy edge infrastructure that supports multiple workloads."

This progression matters for Somana because it validates the platform approach: companies that start with a single use case (e.g., predictive maintenance) quickly discover they need an orchestration layer for managing multiple edge workloads across devices. The alternative — vertical solutions per use case — creates the same fragmentation problem at the software level that [[equipment heterogeneity across vendors protocols and decades is what kills most automation projects|equipment heterogeneity]] creates at the hardware level. Edge Computing Platforms (ECPs) that provide unified orchestration, security, and device management are emerging as the integration layer above the machine edge.

The partnership ecosystem forming around edge AI deployment — AI developers, platform providers, system integrators, sensor manufacturers, telecom providers, vertical solution specialists — suggests this is not a winner-take-all market but an ecosystem play. Somana's positioning as the [[a unified integration layer creates a common nervous system across heterogeneous equipment without replacing anything|integration layer]] that connects to all equipment types aligns with the platform tier rather than the vertical solution tier.

## Relevant Notes
- [[edge compute is necessary for real-time manufacturing control because cloud latency exceeds response requirements]]
- [[equipment heterogeneity across vendors protocols and decades is what kills most automation projects]]
- [[a unified integration layer creates a common nervous system across heterogeneous equipment without replacing anything]]
- [[computer vision inspection runs at 1200 parts per minute on the edge because millisecond latency makes cloud inference impractical]]
- [[only 189 of millions of factories have achieved full digital transformation while 70 percent remain stuck in pilot purgatory]]
