# cross-site knowledge transfer means each subsequent factory deployment ramps faster than the previous one

Everything Somana deploys is configurable and repeatable: workflows, models, integrations. A solution at station 3 on this line can roll out to station 3 on the next line, next factory, across the country. Adapting to a new line is a configuration change, not a new project. Every deployment makes the platform smarter. Transfer isn't perfect (every site has quirks) but it's substantial. In learning curve terms: Somana steepens the slope and carries it across sites. This is Wright's Law applied to the intelligence layer, not just the physical production.

## Relevant Notes
- [[equipment heterogeneity across vendors protocols and decades is what kills most automation projects]]
- [[a unified integration layer creates a common nervous system across heterogeneous equipment without replacing anything]]
- [[quality escapes are the most valuable learning signal because they reveal unknown failure modes]]
- [[AI enables learning transfer across products and factories breaking Wright's Law assumption that learning is product-specific]] — the abstract principle this product feature implements
- [[AI compresses factory ramp timelines because AI capability deploys instantly while human skill takes months to develop]] — faster ramp per site compounds with more sites
