# AI compresses factory ramp timelines because AI capability deploys instantly while human skill takes months to develop

Factory ramp is traditionally constrained by learning — you cannot immediately produce at full rate. Staffing must be hired and trained before production scales. If AI accelerates learning and reduces dependence on skilled labor, the ramp profile steepens dramatically. You don't need to wait for operators to become proficient — the AI is proficient from day one, assuming sufficient training data from simulation or prior deployments.

The "staffing ramp leads production ramp" assumption breaks: AI capability can be deployed instantaneously while the much smaller human team is hired. The "valley of death" between first production and breakeven shortens because AI accelerates the learning that drives unit economics improvement. This is amplified by [[cross-site knowledge transfer means each subsequent factory deployment ramps faster than the previous one|cross-site knowledge transfer]] — each new factory deployment starts with the accumulated learning from all previous ones, making the ramp curve steeper with each successive deployment.

## Relevant Notes
- [[Wright's Law predicts manufacturing costs decline by a fixed percentage with each cumulative production doubling]]
- [[cross-site knowledge transfer means each subsequent factory deployment ramps faster than the previous one]]
- [[the competitive moat shifts from accumulated production volume to data infrastructure quality and AI model sophistication]] — compressed ramp means early movers accumulate data advantage faster, widening the intelligence moat
- [[progressive automation pays for itself when each phase demonstrates ROI before funding the next investment]] — progressive automation IS a compressed ramp: you start producing in Phase 1 (manual, day one) while AI capability layers in incrementally
