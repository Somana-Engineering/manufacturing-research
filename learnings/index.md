# Somana Manufacturing Research

A structured knowledge graph tracking learnings about factory economics, manufacturing mechanics, and production software — built to understand how AI changes the assumptions of manufacturing.

Each note is a discrete insight titled as a prose claim. Notes connect via wiki-links forming a navigable knowledge graph. Use the **graph view** on the right and **explorer** on the left to browse, or start from the topic maps below.

## Research Domains

- [[factory economics]] — unit economics, cost structures, production parameters
- [[somana product]] — edge compute, integration, adaptive control, the mini factory
- [[AI disruption of factory economics]] — how GenAI challenges every conventional assumption in factory economics
- [[manufacturing mechanics]] — process physics, tooling, materials, changeover methodology
- [[manufacturing software]] — control systems, data infrastructure, MES, edge AI

## How to Read This Vault

- **Titles are claims** — each note argues a specific proposition
- **Wiki-links are connections** — follow them to traverse the knowledge graph
- **Frontmatter metadata** — `type`, `status`, `domain_area`, and `source` fields categorize each learning
- **Status lifecycle** — `conventional` (pre-AI wisdom) → `challenged` → `validated` → `superseded`
