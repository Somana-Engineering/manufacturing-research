Welcome to Somana's manufacturing research knowledge system. This vault tracks learnings about factory economics, manufacturing mechanics, and production software — with an emphasis on challenging pre-AI assumptions.

## Research Domains
- [[factory economics]] — unit economics, cost structures, production parameters
- [[somana product]] — edge compute, integration, adaptive control, cross-site learning
- [[AI disruption of factory economics]] — how GenAI challenges every conventional assumption in factory economics
- [[manufacturing mechanics]] — process physics, tooling, materials, changeover methodology
- [[manufacturing software]] — control systems, data infrastructure, MES, edge AI, and how software reshapes the factory stack

## System
- [identity](../self/identity.md) — who the agent is and how it approaches work
- [methodology](../self/methodology.md) — how the agent extracts and connects knowledge
- [goals](../self/goals.md) — current active threads

## Getting Started
1. Read self/identity.md to understand the research mission
2. Process sources from inbox/ through the extraction pipeline
3. Connect learnings across disciplines to build the knowledge graph
