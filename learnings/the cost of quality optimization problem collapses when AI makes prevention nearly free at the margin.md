# the cost of quality optimization problem collapses when AI makes prevention nearly free at the margin

The COQ framework implicitly assumes that prevention costs scale with prevention effort — that more prevention always costs more. AI breaks this: AI-driven prevention (continuous monitoring, real-time process control) has high fixed cost but near-zero marginal cost. The "optimal balance" between prevention and detection was an optimization under the constraint that both cost proportionally. When prevention becomes nearly free at the margin, the optimal answer is "prevent everything" — which was economically impossible before AI.

The four COQ categories (prevention, appraisal, internal failure, external failure) merge into one: "AI quality system cost." This is connected to [[sampling-based quality is design debt from when 100 percent inspection was too expensive for humans|the broader disruption of sampling-based quality]] — when both prevention and detection become near-free through AI, the entire framework for optimizing between them becomes irrelevant. You invest in AI quality infrastructure once and it handles prevention, detection, and diagnosis simultaneously.

## Relevant Notes
- [[in-process quality monitoring transforms final inspection from discovery to confirmation]]
- [[sampling-based quality is design debt from when 100 percent inspection was too expensive for humans]]
- [[computer vision inspection runs at 1200 parts per minute on the edge because millisecond latency makes cloud inference impractical]] — production-deployed proof that prevention/detection at near-zero marginal cost is real
- [[yield improvements create compound cost advantages that materially affect competitive positioning]] — quality cost collapse directly enables yield improvement
