# Wright's Law predicts manufacturing costs decline by a fixed percentage with each cumulative production doubling

Wright's Law: Y = a x X^b, where Y is the average cost for unit X, a is the first-unit cost, and b = log(learning rate) / log(2). An 80% learning curve means costs fall to 80% of the previous level with each cumulative production doubling.

The cost reduction drives through multiple channels simultaneously: labor efficiency, process optimization, yield improvement, design-for-manufacturability evolution, supplier development, and economies of scale. No single channel accounts for the full effect — they reinforce each other.

For factory-as-product companies, competitive position depends on three factors:

1. Cumulative production achieved (how far down the curve you are)
2. Learning rate velocity (how steep the curve is)
3. Capital access enabling faster volume accumulation (the ability to fund production ahead of demand)

This means early movers with capital access can build durable cost advantages that are structurally difficult for later entrants to overcome.

The GenAI disruption audit re-examines all six drivers under AI. Labor efficiency becomes model training (learning not lost when workers quit). Process optimization accelerates as AI removes the cognitive bandwidth bottleneck. Yield improvement flattens the S-curve. DFM feedback loops compress from months to days via generative design. The meta-disruption: AI steepens the learning curve slope, so an 80% curve might become 70%. More fundamentally, AI enables learning transfer across products and factories, breaking Wright's Law assumption that learning is product-specific. See [[AI steepens the learning curve slope so less cumulative volume achieves the same cost reduction]] and [[AI enables learning transfer across products and factories breaking Wright's Law assumption that learning is product-specific]].

## Relevant Notes

- [[yield improvements create compound cost advantages that materially affect competitive positioning]]
- [[factory costs divide into fixed variable and semi-variable categories that determine operating leverage]]
- [[capital structure should evolve from equity to debt as technology risk gives way to execution risk]]
- [[AI steepens the learning curve slope so less cumulative volume achieves the same cost reduction]]
