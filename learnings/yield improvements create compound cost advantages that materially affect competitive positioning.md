# yield improvements create compound cost advantages that materially affect competitive positioning

The economic impact of yield extends far beyond the direct scrap cost. At $80 per unit input cost:

- 70% yield results in $114.29 effective cost per good unit ($80 / 0.70)
- 90% yield results in $88.89 effective cost per good unit ($80 / 0.90)

That $25.40 gap comes entirely from the yield difference, not from different input costs. Both factories buy the same materials at the same price — one just wastes more of them. This makes yield improvement one of the highest-leverage interventions available. A 20-percentage-point yield improvement effectively gives you a 22% cost reduction without negotiating a single supplier contract or changing any input pricing.

Over time, the compound effect deepens: higher yield enables lower prices, which drives higher volume, which funds further yield improvement through learning curve effects.

The GenAI disruption audit challenges yield as a static factory characteristic. AI makes yield dynamic — varying by product, shift, material batch, equipment state, and environmental conditions. Yield becomes a per-unit real-time prediction rather than a factory-level average, enabling dynamic pricing and mid-process stop decisions. The yield improvement S-curve itself is an artifact of human learning dynamics, not physics — AI flattens it by finding non-obvious multivariate root causes from day one. See [[yield becomes a per-unit real-time prediction rather than a factory-level average metric]] and [[AI yield optimization finds multivariate root causes that flatten the S-curve and compress years of learning into months]].
