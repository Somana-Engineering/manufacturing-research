# the gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity narrows under AI because it was largely caused by human and organizational limitations

The gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity is largely caused by human and organizational limitations: suboptimal scheduling, slow changeovers, unplanned downtime, quality problems, coordination failures. AI attacks all of these. The "nameplate is never achieved" assumption is design debt from human-operated factories.

More disruptive: demonstrated capacity as "the only number that matters for planning" is backward-looking. AI enables forward-looking capacity prediction based on current equipment state, scheduled maintenance, material availability, order mix, and even weather (which affects some processes). You don't need to rely on what you did — you can predict what you will do. Planning shifts from historical-based to predictive-based, and the gap between nameplate and effective capacity narrows significantly as AI removes the human coordination constraints that caused it.

## Relevant Notes
- [[OEE decomposes into availability performance and quality to diagnose where operational capacity is lost]]
- [[bottleneck debottlenecking is often the highest-ROI capital investment in operating factories]]
- [[dynamic bottleneck management makes the constraint a managed variable rather than an observed fact]] — one key mechanism for closing the gap
- [[the manufacturing planning cascade from S&OP to MRP to finite scheduling could be collapsed by AI doing real-time planning across all horizons]] — faster planning reduces scheduling-caused underutilization
- [[real-time connected digital twins remain mostly aspirational while offline simulation and virtual commissioning deliver proven value]] — digital twins promise to close the gap but most deployments aren't there yet
