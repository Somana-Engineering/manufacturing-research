# factory costs divide into fixed variable and semi-variable categories that determine operating leverage

Variable costs scale with output: direct materials (30-70% of unit cost), direct labor (15-30%), and consumables. Fixed costs persist regardless of volume: depreciation, fixed labor, facilities, and overhead. Semi-variable costs fall in between: maintenance, quality testing, and yield loss have both fixed and volume-dependent components.

The critical insight is that operating leverage cuts both ways. A factory at 50% capacity doesn't generate 50% profit — it likely runs at a loss, because fixed costs are spread across fewer units. Conversely, a factory running near capacity sees dramatic margin improvement because incremental units carry only their variable cost. This asymmetry means that volume predictability is almost as important as volume itself.

The GenAI disruption audit challenges the entire cost structure framework. Direct labor (15-30%) category-shifts from labor economics to compute economics when AI replaces human workers. Fixed labor — engineers, quality managers, maintenance planners — was treated as irreducible but is partially AI-replaceable. Semi-variable costs like maintenance shift from calendar-based to condition-based. The net effect: the fixed cost base shrinks, operating leverage decreases, and the penalty for underutilization becomes less severe. See [[AI shrinks the fixed cost base making operating leverage less punishing for underutilization and less rewarding for high utilization]] and [[AI transforms direct labor from a human wage cost into a compute cost with fundamentally different scaling properties]].
