# AI yield optimization finds multivariate root causes that flatten the S-curve and compress years of learning into months

The yield improvement S-curve shape is an artifact of human learning dynamics, not physics. The early phase is fast because the problems are obvious to humans. The plateau phase is slow because the remaining problems are subtle and multivariate — hard for humans, routine for AI. Root cause analysis is currently a skilled human activity: gather data, form hypotheses, design experiments, analyze results. GenAI can do this continuously, at scale, across every process parameter simultaneously.

AI should flatten the S-curve: faster initial climb (AI identifies non-obvious problems from day one) and a higher plateau (AI can optimize subtle multivariate relationships that humans never could). The strategic insight that "a factory at 75% improving 5 points/quarter will outcompete one stuck at 85%" becomes: "a factory with AI will improve faster at ALL points on the curve." This directly attacks the competitive moat of accumulated production experience. If AI compresses the yield learning timeline from years to months, first-mover advantage shrinks dramatically. A new entrant with AI doesn't need to produce millions of units — they need good data infrastructure and good models.

## Relevant Notes
- [[yield improvements create compound cost advantages that materially affect competitive positioning]]
- [[Wright's Law predicts manufacturing costs decline by a fixed percentage with each cumulative production doubling]]
