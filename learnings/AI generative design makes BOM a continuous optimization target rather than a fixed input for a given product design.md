# AI generative design makes BOM a continuous optimization target rather than a fixed input for a given product design

Material costs are the most resilient to AI disruption — physics doesn't care about AI, you still need steel, polymers, copper. But GenAI enables generative design that optimizes material usage far beyond what human engineers can achieve. AI can explore millions of design variants to minimize material while maintaining structural requirements. This means BOM cost isn't just about negotiating better prices for the same design — it's about redesigning the product continuously to use less material.

Additionally, AI-driven supply chain optimization can find alternative materials, predict commodity price movements, and dynamically substitute materials based on real-time pricing — turning a "negotiate once, buy repeatedly" process into a continuous optimization. The line between "design" and "procurement" blurs when AI can adjust both simultaneously.

Where [[customization inverts the small-scale penalty into a premium when each product is inherently unique|products are inherently customized]], generative design becomes per-customer optimization — each unit gets a design variant tuned to specific requirements, material availability, and cost targets. The design file IS the [[digital inventory replaces physical warehousing making on-demand micro-manufacturing economically rational at any scale|digital inventory]]: stored as parameters, instantiated on demand, never warehoused. This makes generative design a core component of the [[in micro-manufacturing the competitive moat is software not hardware because design automation and scheduling determine who can serve high-mix demand profitably|software moat]] — the company that can generate optimized designs per order at near-zero marginal cost wins the high-mix market.

## Relevant Notes
- [[factory costs divide into fixed variable and semi-variable categories that determine operating leverage]]
- [[customization inverts the small-scale penalty into a premium when each product is inherently unique]] — generative design enables per-customer optimization at zero marginal design cost
- [[digital inventory replaces physical warehousing making on-demand micro-manufacturing economically rational at any scale]] — parametric design files ARE the digital inventory
- [[in micro-manufacturing the competitive moat is software not hardware because design automation and scheduling determine who can serve high-mix demand profitably]] — design automation is a core layer of the software moat
- [[material properties create hard constraints on manufacturing process selection where ductility limits formability hardness dictates cutting forces and melting point governs joining]] — generative design optimizes within material constraints, not against them
