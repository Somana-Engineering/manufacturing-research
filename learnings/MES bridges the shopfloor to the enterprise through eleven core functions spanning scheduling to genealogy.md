# MES bridges the shopfloor to the enterprise through eleven core functions spanning scheduling to genealogy

The Manufacturing Execution System is the operational backbone connecting real-time production to business planning. MESA International defined 11 core functions: operations scheduling, resource allocation, dispatching, document control, product tracking/genealogy, performance analysis, labor management, maintenance management, process management, quality management, and data collection. These map directly to ISA-95's four Level 3 activity domains.

The MES market reached $15-17B in 2025, projected to $25-34B by 2030. The competitive landscape ranges from enterprise giants (Siemens Opcenter, SAP Digital Manufacturing, Dassault DELMIA) to cloud-native disruptors (Rockwell Plex SaaS on Azure, acquired for $2.22B) to democratizing models (Ignition + Sepasoft modules at per-server pricing). The dominant architectural trend is hybrid cloud MES: real-time execution stays on-premise because latency, cybersecurity, and business continuity concerns keep critical execution local, while analytics and multi-site aggregation move to cloud. Research confirms this split — latency concerns "have long prevented and are currently preventing" full cloud migration for execution-critical functions.
