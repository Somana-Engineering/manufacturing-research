# SMED attacks changeover time through a five-step framework that separates internal from external work reducing setup by an average of 94 percent

SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) was developed by Shigeo Shingo at Toyota in the 1950s when stamping press changeovers took up to 4 hours, making small-batch production incompatible with Just-In-Time. "Single-minute" means under 10 minutes. The scope: everything between the last good unit of the previous batch and the first good unit of the next — stoppages, adjustments, cleaning, preparation.

The five steps: (1) Study current situation — film, time, and categorize all 30-50 discrete changeover elements. (2) **Separate internal work (machine stopped) from external work (machine running)** — this step alone typically cuts changeover time nearly in half. (3) Convert internal tasks to external — preheat molds, standardize heights, pre-assemble offline. (4) Streamline remaining internal work — quick-release fasteners replacing bolts, parallel "pit-stop" operations, eliminate adjustments via standardized settings. (5) Reduce external work — 5S organization, tools at point of use.

Shingo documented average reductions of 94% — from hours to single-digit minutes. Between 1975 and 1985, average setup times fell to 2.5% of original time (40x improvement). Industry examples: automotive Tier-1 reduced press setups from 4 hours to 7 minutes; electronics SMT changeovers dropped from 120 minutes to under 15 minutes; medical catheter mold exchanges achieved under 120 seconds.

Changeover time is a major component of the non-processing time that dominates [[processing time is typically less than 10 percent of total manufacturing cycle time|the 90%+ of cycle time that isn't actual processing]]. SMED provides the structured methodology for attacking it. The connection to batch economics is direct: [[setup cost and optimal batch size are mathematically linked through EOQ so reducing changeover time enables smaller batches and leaner inventory|lower setup cost enables smaller batches]] via the EOQ formula, which enables leaner flow, lower WIP, and shorter [[cash conversion cycle measures how long cash stays tied up in operations|cash conversion cycles]].

## Relevant Notes
- [[setup cost and optimal batch size are mathematically linked through EOQ so reducing changeover time enables smaller batches and leaner inventory]]
- [[processing time is typically less than 10 percent of total manufacturing cycle time]]
- [[takt time synchronizes production pace to customer demand]]
- [[cash conversion cycle measures how long cash stays tied up in operations]]
- [[OTED extends SMED toward sub-100-second automated changeovers where AI and robotics could eliminate changeover as a human process entirely]]
