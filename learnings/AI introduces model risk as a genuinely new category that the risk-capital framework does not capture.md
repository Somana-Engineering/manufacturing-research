# AI introduces model risk as a genuinely new category that the risk-capital framework does not capture

AI reduces technology and scale-up risk by enabling better simulation, faster iteration, and more predictive modeling of process outcomes. This means companies might use less equity and more debt earlier in their lifecycle. But AI simultaneously introduces a genuinely new risk type: model risk. What if the AI's process control model is wrong? What if it optimizes for a local minimum? What if it creates hidden failure modes that only manifest under specific conditions?

This is a new category that doesn't map cleanly to the existing risk-capital framework. The traditional framework assumes technology risk is binary (works or doesn't) and execution risk is continuous (get better over time). Model risk is neither — it's continuous, subtle, and can compound silently. The risk evolution accelerates (faster progression from equity-appropriate to debt-appropriate) but introduces new dimensions that the traditional framework from [[capital structure should evolve from equity to debt as technology risk gives way to execution risk|the a16z primer]] doesn't capture.

## Relevant Notes
- [[capital structure should evolve from equity to debt as technology risk gives way to execution risk]]
