# AI transforms direct labor from a human wage cost into a compute cost with fundamentally different scaling properties

The "direct labor" category itself is design debt. It assumes humans are doing the work and that more output requires more humans. With AI-driven robotics and AI agents controlling automation equipment, "direct labor" increasingly becomes "compute cost" — which has completely different scaling properties. Compute cost per unit can decrease with scale (amortized model training, cheaper inference at volume), whereas human labor cost per unit is roughly flat or increases (overtime, fatigue, shifts).

The entire cost category needs rethinking: is it labor, or is it "intelligence cost per unit"? If it's intelligence cost, it follows [[Wright's Law predicts manufacturing costs decline by a fixed percentage with each cumulative production doubling|Wright's Law for semiconductors]], not labor economics. For a Somana-style operation, the cost of the AI agent writing integration code for a robot arm isn't "labor" in any traditional sense — it's closer to a software licensing cost with marginal cost approaching zero.

## Relevant Notes
- [[factory costs divide into fixed variable and semi-variable categories that determine operating leverage]]
- [[Wright's Law predicts manufacturing costs decline by a fixed percentage with each cumulative production doubling]]
- [[in micro-manufacturing the competitive moat is software not hardware because design automation and scheduling determine who can serve high-mix demand profitably]] — the labor→compute shift IS the mechanism behind the software moat: when "labor" is software, hiring scales like licensing
- [[customization inverts the small-scale penalty into a premium when each product is inherently unique]] — compute cost per variant approaches zero while human labor cost per variant is roughly constant, making customization feasible only under the compute model
- [[AI compresses factory ramp timelines because AI capability deploys instantly while human skill takes months to develop]] — compute skills deploy instantly; human skills require months of training per new product or process
