# takt time synchronizes production pace to customer demand

Takt time = Available Production Time / Customer Demand

It sets the rhythm of production: one unit must complete every takt-time interval to meet demand. Takt time is the clock that synchronizes the whole line, translating external demand into an internal operational cadence.

The relationship between cycle time and takt time determines capacity decisions:

- When process cycle time exceeds takt time, the station cannot keep up — you need parallel capacity (additional machines or shifts).
- When cycle time significantly undershoots takt time, it suggests excess capacity at that station or opportunities for batching.
- When cycle time approximately equals takt time, the station is well-matched to demand but has no buffer for variability.

The goal is to balance all stations as close to takt time as possible without exceeding it, minimizing both idle capacity and bottlenecks simultaneously.

## Relevant Notes

- [[processing time is typically less than 10 percent of total manufacturing cycle time]]
- [[bottleneck debottlenecking is often the highest-ROI capital investment in operating factories]]
- [[Little's Law connects WIP throughput and cycle time as WIP equals throughput times cycle time]]
- [[manufacturing line parameters form a connected system where takt time is the only external input and five leverage points determine where intervention cascades most]] — takt time is the ONLY externally-determined parameter in the system; everything else is a design choice or operational outcome
