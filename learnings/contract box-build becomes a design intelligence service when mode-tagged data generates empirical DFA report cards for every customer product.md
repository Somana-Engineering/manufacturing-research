# contract box-build becomes a design intelligence service when mode-tagged data generates empirical DFA report cards for every customer product

Conventional contract electronics manufacturers (CEMs) provide DFM/DFA feedback as part of their NPI (New Product Introduction) process. But this feedback is typically qualitative ("this connector is hard to route"), based on engineer opinion not production data, delivered once during design review, and generic (follows Boothroyd-Dewhurst tables) rather than specific to the actual manufacturing environment.

Somana's differentiation: because the factory runs all three modes on every product, each customer's product generates its own empirical DFA report card. The feedback loop:

1. Customer sends product design for box-build contract
2. First batch runs through all three modes (or Manual + Autonomous minimum)
3. [[the per-step mode gap replaces DFA table lookups with empirical production measurements of assembly difficulty|Per-step mode gap analysis]] identifies specific steps with poor assembly design
4. [[the assisted mode differentiates information problems from physical design problems in assembly steps|Assisted mode diagnostic]] classifies each problem as informational or physical
5. [[mode gap data enables specific actionable redesign recommendations where traditional DFA only provides generic guidelines|System generates specific redesign recommendations]]: "Step 4 (cable routing) has a 340% mode gap — routing through a channel would reduce this to <50%"
6. Customer iterates design; next batch shows measurable improvement
7. Continuous: every production run refines the model for that product

This transforms [[contract box-build assembly for 10 to 500 units is massively underserved because tooling costs and minimum order quantities block hardware startups|contract box-build]] from a commodity service (anyone can assemble a box) into a design-intelligence service (we quantify exactly how your design affects production and tell you what to fix). The premium over commodity assembly is justified by demonstrable value: customers who iterate based on DFA feedback see measurable per-unit cost reductions in subsequent batches.

The service model creates a natural retention loop. The first batch generates the DFA report. The customer redesigns. The second batch validates the improvement and generates new, finer-grained recommendations. The customer is incentivized to stay with Somana for subsequent batches because the DFA model for their specific product improves with every run — switching to a commodity assembler means losing that accumulated design intelligence.

Relevant Notes:
- [[contract box-build assembly for 10 to 500 units is massively underserved because tooling costs and minimum order quantities block hardware startups]] — the market gap this service fills, now with a design intelligence differentiator
- [[the per-step mode gap replaces DFA table lookups with empirical production measurements of assembly difficulty]] — the measurement that makes the report card possible
- [[the assisted mode differentiates information problems from physical design problems in assembly steps]] — the diagnostic that makes recommendations specific
- [[mode gap data enables specific actionable redesign recommendations where traditional DFA only provides generic guidelines]] — the output that makes the service worth paying for
- [[the DFA feedback engine creates a virtuous data flywheel where each assembled product improves diagnostic accuracy for future products]] — every customer product improves the system for future customers
- [[the DFA feedback engine is an analytical layer on existing mode-tagged data infrastructure not a new data system]] — zero incremental data cost; the service is analytically free to produce
- [[demo factories that convert visitors combine recognizable products visible customization a moment of truth and product changeover as the primary demonstration]] — visitors realize "you could generate this DFA report for MY product"
