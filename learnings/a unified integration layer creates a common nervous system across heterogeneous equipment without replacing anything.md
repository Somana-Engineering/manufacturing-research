# a unified integration layer creates a common nervous system across heterogeneous equipment without replacing anything

Somana's Nexus connects to all equipment types: PLCs, sensors, robots, cameras, control systems — pulled into one software layer. Not replacing equipment, giving it a common nervous system. The operator who checked four screens now checks one. The engineer who wrote custom glue code now configures cross-line workflows. Data that lived in silos flows into a single view: machine logs, quality records, sensor streams. This is the core product proposition: turn existing equipment into flexible, AI-driven production systems.

The broader industry is converging on a similar architectural need through different paths. [[the Unified Namespace promises any-to-any data flow but UNS without governance becomes chaos at scale|The Unified Namespace (UNS)]] uses an MQTT broker as a central hub to replace N×N point-to-point integrations. [[OPC UA provides semantic richness at the machine edge while MQTT provides scalable distribution across the enterprise|OPC UA provides semantic data models at the machine edge while MQTT handles scalable distribution]]. Both approaches validate the same insight: heterogeneous equipment needs a unifying data layer. Where Somana's approach differs is in combining integration with intelligence — not just connecting machines into a common namespace, but making that connected data immediately actionable through [[adaptive control responds to condition combinations too complex for human-authored rules|adaptive control]] and [[continuous process monitoring collapses the metrics hierarchy by seeing all four levels simultaneously|continuous monitoring]]. The UNS movement shows the market demand; the question is whether integration alone (plumbing) or integration plus intelligence (nervous system) wins.

## Relevant Notes
- [[equipment heterogeneity across vendors protocols and decades is what kills most automation projects]]
- [[edge compute is necessary for real-time manufacturing control because cloud latency exceeds response requirements]]
- [[continuous process monitoring collapses the metrics hierarchy by seeing all four levels simultaneously]]
- [[the Unified Namespace promises any-to-any data flow but UNS without governance becomes chaos at scale]]
- [[OPC UA provides semantic richness at the machine edge while MQTT provides scalable distribution across the enterprise]]
- [[nine software layers span from embedded PLC firmware to cloud AI platforms with the ISA-95 pyramid as persistent organizational backbone]]
