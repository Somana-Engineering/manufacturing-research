# AI disruption of factory economics

Systematic analysis of how GenAI attacks the assumptions underlying factory economics. The meta-pattern: every simplification, aggregation, sampling strategy, and periodic review was necessary because humans couldn't process granular, continuous, multivariate reality. AI can.

## The Framework
- [[institutional design debt accumulates when systems optimize for constraints that technology has already eliminated]] — the foundational concept that unifies all disruptions below

## Cost Structure Disruption
- [[AI transforms direct labor from a human wage cost into a compute cost with fundamentally different scaling properties]] — the 15-30% labor category shifts from labor economics to semiconductor economics
- [[AI generative design makes BOM a continuous optimization target rather than a fixed input for a given product design]] — product design becomes fluid, blurring the line between design and procurement
- [[AI process control squeezes out the safety margins baked into consumable usage rates by operating continuously at the efficient frontier]] — variable costs get tighter and lower
- [[AI shrinks the fixed cost base making operating leverage less punishing for underutilization and less rewarding for high utilization]] — the single biggest design debt item: fixed labor becomes partially variable
- [[AI-driven overhead automation democratizes enterprise-grade quality systems for small-batch manufacturers]] — compliance and quality systems become affordable at any scale
- [[AI shifts maintenance from semi-variable calendar-based to fully variable condition-based with lower total cost]] — calendar-based maintenance is pure design debt

## Yield & Quality Disruption
- [[sampling-based quality is design debt from when 100 percent inspection was too expensive for humans]] — AQL is an artifact of inspection cost constraints
- [[AI yield optimization finds multivariate root causes that flatten the S-curve and compress years of learning into months]] — the S-curve is a human learning artifact, not physics
- [[AI transforms incoming material variation from a yield problem into a process control input]] — adapt parameters to each batch rather than rejecting at the door
- [[cross-step dependency modeling circumvents the multiplicative yield penalty by optimizing the entire process chain as a system]] — the independence assumption in FPY is design debt
- [[yield becomes a per-unit real-time prediction rather than a factory-level average metric]] — "a factory's yield is 70%" becomes meaninglessly aggregated
- [[the cost of quality optimization problem collapses when AI makes prevention nearly free at the margin]] — COQ framework assumes prevention costs scale with effort

## Learning Curve Disruption
- [[AI steepens the learning curve slope so less cumulative volume achieves the same cost reduction]] — all six Wright's Law drivers accelerate under AI
- [[AI enables learning transfer across products and factories breaking Wright's Law assumption that learning is product-specific]] — cumulative volume measured at company or industry level
- [[the competitive moat shifts from accumulated production volume to data infrastructure quality and AI model sophistication]] — the Somana thesis distilled
- [[in micro-manufacturing the competitive moat is software not hardware because design automation and scheduling determine who can serve high-mix demand profitably]] — extends the moat thesis from process optimization to the full manufacturing business model
- [[customization inverts the small-scale penalty into a premium when each product is inherently unique]] — AI collapses the cost of variety management, making batch-of-one economics rational

## Working Capital Disruption
- [[cash conversion cycle measures how long cash stays tied up in operations]] — AI attacks all three CCC components; could cut a 75-day cycle to 40-50 days
- [[digital inventory replaces physical warehousing making on-demand micro-manufacturing economically rational at any scale]] — the most radical attack on CCC: eliminates DIO entirely via digital files instead of physical parts

## Capacity & Flow Disruption
- [[the gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity narrows under AI because it was largely caused by human and organizational limitations]] — planning shifts from historical to predictive
- [[dynamic bottleneck management makes the constraint a managed variable rather than an observed fact]] — Theory of Constraints evolves from "find and exploit" to "continuously optimize"
- [[AI reduces cycle time not by making processing faster but by eliminating the 90 percent of time that is coordination waste]] — massive working capital implications via Little's Law
- [[AI compresses factory ramp timelines because AI capability deploys instantly while human skill takes months to develop]] — the valley of death shortens

## Tensions
- [[OEE framework becomes less useful as its simplifying assumptions become limitations rather than helpful abstractions]] — useful for humans, misleading for AI
- [[AI introduces model risk as a genuinely new category that the risk-capital framework does not capture]] — new risk type that doesn't map to equity-debt spectrum

## Open Questions
- [[what is the minimum data infrastructure investment needed to realize AI-driven manufacturing economics]] — critical for Somana capital planning
- [[how does AI model risk map to the existing risk-capital matching framework for manufacturing financing]] — new financing models needed?

Agent Notes:
- 2026-02-20: Added Working Capital Disruption section (CCC + digital inventory) and expanded Learning Curve section with software moat and customization learnings. The product research learnings strengthen the moat thesis with concrete market evidence (Cimpress $3.4B, Bright Machines 4-hour NPI). These extend the disruption audit from theoretical to empirically validated.
