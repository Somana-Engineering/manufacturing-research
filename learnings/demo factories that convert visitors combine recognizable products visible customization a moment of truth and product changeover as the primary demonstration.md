# demo factories that convert visitors combine recognizable products visible customization a moment of truth and product changeover as the primary demonstration

The most successful smart factory demonstrators worldwide converge on a consistent formula. Festo's CP Factory assembles mockup mobile phones with customizable shells — the product is instantly recognizable, the assembly steps are visible, and color variants demonstrate changeover. SmartFactoryKL in Kaiserslautern produces USB memory sticks housed in LEGO-like bricks, configurable via web interface with ERP integration, demonstrating lot-size-1 production across equipment from 11 different vendors. Fraunhofer IPK goes simpler: customizable drink coasters with embedded sensors. Siemens Amberg — the gold standard — produces real SIMATIC PLCs across 1,200 variants with 350 changeovers per day and conducts over 400 factory tours annually at a 99.9988% quality rate.

Four elements recur across all successful demos: (1) a recognizable consumer object, not an abstract industrial part; (2) visible customization so visitors see different variants produced; (3) a "moment of truth" — a light turning on, a test passing with a green indicator, a reading appearing on a dashboard; and (4) ideally, visitors take the product home, creating lasting recall. The strongest format: visitor configures a product on screen, watches it get manufactured, takes it home.

But the deepest insight is that the changeover itself is the primary demo. Siemens does 350 per day. A micro-factory performing 3–4 changeovers during a 15-minute tour — switching from boarding boxes to IoT sensors to STEM kits — tells the same story at human scale. The products prove the line works; the [[SMED attacks changeover time through a five-step framework that separates internal from external work reducing setup by an average of 94 percent|changeover]] proves the platform handles manufacturing complexity. Bright Machines reinforces this: their demo uses real data center hardware with [[OTED extends SMED toward sub-100-second automated changeovers where AI and robotics could eliminate changeover as a human process entirely|NPI in under 4 hours]] and zero changeover time between SKUs.

But there is a level beyond product changeover: mode switching. [[a togglable mode dial that switches each station between manual assisted and autonomous generates live comparative evidence that software creates measurable value|Switching a station between Manual, Assisted, and Autonomous modes]] isolates the software variable while holding everything else constant. Product changeover proves the platform handles variety; mode switching proves the software creates measurable value on the SAME product. The combination — switching products AND switching modes — is the ultimate demo: every permutation generates unique comparative evidence.

The strongest single demo moment may be the compounding OEE formula: [[the compounding OEE formula is powerful demo content showing visitors how small per-station improvements cascade into large system gains|switching one station from Manual to Autonomous visibly lifts the system OEE number]] by more than the naive per-station improvement. The multiplicative compounding is counterintuitive and therefore memorable — visitors leave understanding that per-station software improvement cascades non-linearly across the whole line.

The demo also has a post-visit value proposition. For contract customers, [[contract box-build becomes a design intelligence service when mode-tagged data generates empirical DFA report cards for every customer product|every assembled product generates an empirical DFA report card]]. The same mode-tagged data that powers the live demo accumulates into design intelligence that transforms commodity assembly into a consultancy relationship. Visitors don't just see a factory — they see the data service their own products would generate.

## Relevant Notes
- [[a togglable mode dial that switches each station between manual assisted and autonomous generates live comparative evidence that software creates measurable value]] — mode switching is a more powerful moment of truth than product changeover
- [[SMED attacks changeover time through a five-step framework that separates internal from external work reducing setup by an average of 94 percent]] — changeover visibility IS the demo
- [[OTED extends SMED toward sub-100-second automated changeovers where AI and robotics could eliminate changeover as a human process entirely]] — Bright Machines demonstrates this with real products
- [[customization inverts the small-scale penalty into a premium when each product is inherently unique]] — visitor-configured products make customization tangible
- [[ISA-88 recipe management separates what to make from how to make it through four recipe types cascading from R&D to execution]] — recipe switching is the mechanism behind seamless changeover
- [[desktop-scale industrial automation now costs 15 to 50K and exposes the same data protocols as full-scale factory equipment]] — the equipment to build a demo factory is now affordable
- [[U-shaped assembly cells provide 2-3x more task combinations than straight lines by letting operators start and finish at the same point]] — dual-purpose layout solves the production-vs-demo tension in ~20x20 ft
- [[contract box-build assembly for 10 to 500 units is massively underserved because tooling costs and minimum order quantities block hardware startups]] — the demo implicitly sells assembly-as-a-service: visitors see their products being assembled here
- [[the compounding OEE formula is powerful demo content showing visitors how small per-station improvements cascade into large system gains]] — the multiplicative OEE cascade is the most powerful single "moment of truth" in the demo
- [[contract box-build becomes a design intelligence service when mode-tagged data generates empirical DFA report cards for every customer product]] — the demo's post-visit value: assembly data becomes design intelligence for each customer
- [[the mode comparison dashboard must update within 1-2 seconds of a mode change to maintain the cause-and-effect demo experience which demands edge processing]] — sub-2-second dashboard update is what makes the mode switching moment visceral
- [[torque specifications for fasteners provide an ideal measurable parameter for demonstrating mode dial differences across manual assisted and autonomous assembly]] — torque accuracy is a tangible, per-station metric visitors can see diverge by mode
