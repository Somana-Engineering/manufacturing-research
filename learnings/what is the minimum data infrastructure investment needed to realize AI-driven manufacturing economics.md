# what is the minimum data infrastructure investment needed to realize AI-driven manufacturing economics

The GenAI disruption audit argues that data infrastructure and AI model sophistication replace accumulated production volume as the primary competitive moat in manufacturing. But what does "data infrastructure" actually cost? The components: sensors and edge compute hardware, data pipelines and storage, compute for model training and inference, integration layer across heterogeneous equipment. What is the minimum viable investment to get meaningful AI-driven yield improvement, predictive maintenance, and adaptive control?

This question is critical for Somana's capital planning — the answer determines whether the AI-driven economics are accessible to startups or only to well-funded incumbents. If the infrastructure cost is low relative to traditional factory CapEx, then the disruption thesis is even stronger: not only does AI change the economics, it lowers the barrier to entry.

## Relevant Notes
- [[the competitive moat shifts from accumulated production volume to data infrastructure quality and AI model sophistication]]
- [[edge compute is necessary for real-time manufacturing control because cloud latency exceeds response requirements]]
