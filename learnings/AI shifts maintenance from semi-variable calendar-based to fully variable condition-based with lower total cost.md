# AI shifts maintenance from semi-variable calendar-based to fully variable condition-based with lower total cost

"Partially predictable" failure modes is the design debt phrase. With GenAI analyzing continuous sensor streams, vibration data, thermal profiles, power consumption patterns, and cross-referencing against failure history across thousands of similar machines worldwide, failure modes become highly predictable. The calendar-based fixed component of maintenance — the "just check it every month" approach — is pure design debt. It exists because we couldn't continuously assess equipment health. AI can.

More interesting: GenAI can also generate maintenance procedures, troubleshooting guides, and repair instructions on-the-fly, reducing the skill requirements for maintenance technicians. The maintenance person doesn't need to be an expert on every machine — they need to follow AI-generated instructions. Maintenance shifts almost entirely from semi-variable to variable (usage-based, condition-based), with much lower total cost. The "fixed" maintenance headcount decreases as AI handles diagnosis and procedure generation. This extends what [[predictive maintenance uses already-flowing process data rather than requiring dedicated condition monitoring hardware|Somana already enables]] into the full economic restructuring of maintenance costs.

## Relevant Notes
- [[predictive maintenance uses already-flowing process data rather than requiring dedicated condition monitoring hardware]]
- [[factory costs divide into fixed variable and semi-variable categories that determine operating leverage]]
- [[the VUT equation shows that cycle time grows exponentially with utilization when variability is present creating a trap most factories fall into]] — calendar-based maintenance creates scheduled availability drops (variability in the V term); condition-based maintenance smooths availability, reducing queue time
- [[the gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity narrows under AI because it was largely caused by human and organizational limitations]] — unplanned downtime from inadequate maintenance is a primary cause of the nameplate-demonstrated gap
- [[variability must be buffered by inventory capacity or time and lean manufacturing minimizes the total cost of buffering not the buffers themselves]] — calendar maintenance forces capacity buffers (spare machines, overtime); condition-based maintenance reduces total buffering cost
