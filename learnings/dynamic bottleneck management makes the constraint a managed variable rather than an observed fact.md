# dynamic bottleneck management makes the constraint a managed variable rather than an observed fact

The bottleneck identification process is design debt. Currently, identifying the bottleneck is a skilled human activity: observe the floor, analyze data, discuss with operators. AI can identify bottlenecks in real-time, predict when bottlenecks will shift, and dynamically rebalance production to mitigate constraints.

More interesting: AI enables dynamic bottleneck management. Instead of accepting the bottleneck and building strategy around it (the Theory of Constraints approach), AI can reconfigure production flows, adjust batch sizes, reschedule jobs, and modify process parameters to shift the bottleneck to the least costly location. The bottleneck becomes a managed variable rather than an observed constraint. The Theory of Constraints framework evolves from "find the bottleneck and exploit it" to "continuously optimize the constraint landscape across the entire system." The concept of a single, identifiable bottleneck may become less meaningful in AI-managed systems where constraints are fluid and actively managed.

## Relevant Notes
- [[bottleneck debottlenecking is often the highest-ROI capital investment in operating factories]]
- [[processing time is typically less than 10 percent of total manufacturing cycle time]]
- [[SMED attacks changeover time through a five-step framework that separates internal from external work reducing setup by an average of 94 percent]] — changeover time is often what creates the bottleneck; SMED reduces it
- [[setup cost and optimal batch size are mathematically linked through EOQ so reducing changeover time enables smaller batches and leaner inventory]] — batch size changes shift where bottlenecks appear
