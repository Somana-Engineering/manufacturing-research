# Somana: A Tour of Our Model Factory

Internal document presenting Somana's product vision through a narrative factory walkthrough. Covers eight stops: edge compute, integration layer, production monitoring, production control, quality station, maintenance bay, multi-site scaling, and results metrics.

Key themes extracted: edge-first architecture, equipment heterogeneity as the core challenge, observe-control-improve loop, quality as continuous process property, predictive maintenance from existing data streams, and cross-site knowledge transfer as a learning curve accelerator.
