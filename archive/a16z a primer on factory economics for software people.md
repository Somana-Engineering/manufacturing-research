# a16z a primer on factory economics for software people

## Summary

This a16z article provides a comprehensive primer on factory economics aimed at software-oriented founders and investors entering hardware and manufacturing. It covers the full landscape of manufacturing cost structures, from the fixed/variable/semi-variable cost taxonomy through yield economics, learning curves (Wright's Law), OEE decomposition, cycle time analysis, bottleneck theory, metrics hierarchies, working capital (cash conversion cycle), and capital structure evolution.

## Notes Extracted

1. [[factory costs divide into fixed variable and semi-variable categories that determine operating leverage]]
2. [[rolled throughput yield compounds across process steps making each step's quality critical]]
3. [[yield improvements create compound cost advantages that materially affect competitive positioning]]
4. [[Wright's Law predicts manufacturing costs decline by a fixed percentage with each cumulative production doubling]]
5. [[OEE decomposes into availability performance and quality to diagnose where operational capacity is lost]]
6. [[processing time is typically less than 10 percent of total manufacturing cycle time]]
7. [[Little's Law connects WIP throughput and cycle time as WIP equals throughput times cycle time]]
8. [[takt time synchronizes production pace to customer demand]]
9. [[bottleneck debottlenecking is often the highest-ROI capital investment in operating factories]]
10. [[the manufacturing metrics hierarchy cascades from financial outcomes to root cause indicators across four levels]]
11. [[cash conversion cycle measures how long cash stays tied up in operations]]
12. [[capital structure should evolve from equity to debt as technology risk gives way to execution risk]]
