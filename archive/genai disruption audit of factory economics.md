# genai disruption audit of factory economics

Systematic GenAI disruption analysis of the a16z factory economics primer. Goes concept by concept — cost structures, yield, Wright's Law, OEE, bottleneck theory, metrics hierarchy, cycle time, capital structure — and identifies the design debt in each: assumptions rooted in human cognitive constraints that AI eliminates.

## Key Thesis

**Institutional design debt:** When a system is designed under constraint C and technology eliminates C, the system carries design debt — optimizing for a constraint that no longer binds. Applied to manufacturing, every metric, framework, and process was designed when human cognition was the only analytical tool.

## Extracted Notes

### Learnings (20)
1. [[institutional design debt accumulates when systems optimize for constraints that technology has already eliminated]]
2. [[AI transforms direct labor from a human wage cost into a compute cost with fundamentally different scaling properties]]
3. [[AI generative design makes BOM a continuous optimization target rather than a fixed input for a given product design]]
4. [[AI process control squeezes out the safety margins baked into consumable usage rates by operating continuously at the efficient frontier]]
5. [[AI shrinks the fixed cost base making operating leverage less punishing for underutilization and less rewarding for high utilization]]
6. [[AI-driven overhead automation democratizes enterprise-grade quality systems for small-batch manufacturers]]
7. [[AI shifts maintenance from semi-variable calendar-based to fully variable condition-based with lower total cost]]
8. [[sampling-based quality is design debt from when 100 percent inspection was too expensive for humans]]
9. [[AI yield optimization finds multivariate root causes that flatten the S-curve and compress years of learning into months]]
10. [[AI transforms incoming material variation from a yield problem into a process control input]]
11. [[cross-step dependency modeling circumvents the multiplicative yield penalty by optimizing the entire process chain as a system]]
12. [[yield becomes a per-unit real-time prediction rather than a factory-level average metric]]
13. [[AI enables learning transfer across products and factories breaking Wright's Law assumption that learning is product-specific]]
14. [[AI steepens the learning curve slope so less cumulative volume achieves the same cost reduction]]
15. [[the gap between nameplate and demonstrated capacity narrows under AI because it was largely caused by human and organizational limitations]]
16. [[the cost of quality optimization problem collapses when AI makes prevention nearly free at the margin]]
17. [[dynamic bottleneck management makes the constraint a managed variable rather than an observed fact]]
18. [[AI compresses factory ramp timelines because AI capability deploys instantly while human skill takes months to develop]]
19. [[the competitive moat shifts from accumulated production volume to data infrastructure quality and AI model sophistication]]
20. [[AI reduces cycle time not by making processing faster but by eliminating the 90 percent of time that is coordination waste]]

### Tensions (2)
1. [[AI introduces model risk as a genuinely new category that the risk-capital framework does not capture]]
2. [[OEE framework becomes less useful as its simplifying assumptions become limitations rather than helpful abstractions]]

### Questions (2)
1. [[what is the minimum data infrastructure investment needed to realize AI-driven manufacturing economics]]
2. [[how does AI model risk map to the existing risk-capital matching framework for manufacturing financing]]

### Enrichments Applied (8)
Updated existing learnings with AI disruption context: factory costs, Wright's Law, yield improvements, OEE, bottleneck debottlenecking, metrics hierarchy, capital structure, cash conversion cycle.
